Importance of Time Complexity in Algorthims
Performance Benchmark
1. Growth Behavior with Input Size:
Time complexity predicts how an algorithm’s runtime changes as input size grows.
Example: Binary Search O(logn) scales far better than Linear Search O(n).
2. Critical for Large-Scale Applications:
Algorithms must handle vast datasets efficiently in modern applications like:
• Machine learning (processing millions of data points).
• Big data (searching billions of records).
Real-World Impact
• Search Engines:
  Algorithms like PageRank analyze and rank billions of web pages efficiently.
Trade-offs
• Speed vs. Memory Usage:
  Faster algorithms often require more memory (e.g., storing sorted data for quick retrieval).
Example: Merge Sort O(nlogn) uses additional memory, while Quick Sort works in-place but requires careful optimization.
